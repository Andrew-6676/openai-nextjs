This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

# Don't forget to create `.env` file!
First, create `.env` file (from `.env.template`).
Contact me and I will share values for `.env` with you.

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Social login
Social login configured only for `localhost:3000`

## Without authentication
Switch to `no-auth` branch if you have problem with authentication.
